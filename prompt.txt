I have a ToDo.jsx in this folder.
I want you to refactor this file into a either a proper complete professional React application or a NextJS application - i cannot decide which one is better.
Maybe you can help me make a determination on this.
For the first refactoring pass, I want you to keep everything as local storage.
Then in the next pass,  I will have you refactor it for supabase database tables and help me with the migration.
I will be hosting this on Vercel, but I want you to use gh GitHub CLI to create my remote repo and deploy it - and then I will connect it with Vercel and then after that every time you push the code to GitHub, vercel will deploy it automatically.
But before you push any code to GitHub, make sure you create a build that works on my machine. 

So create a document for me with your suggestions and then I will tell you what i prefer to do.

Ok let's go with Nextjs and yes, proceed with the refactoring.
I will be hosting this on Vercel, but I want you to use gh GitHub CLI to create my remote repo and deploy it - always name the repo the same name as the root folder of the project - and then I will connect it with Vercel and then after that every time you push the code to GitHub, vercel will deploy it automatically.
But before you push any code to GitHub, make sure you create a build that works on my machine. 


Also, i have included my requests to you so far in a file called prompt.txt
I want you to rewrite that in a professional proper complete way so that I can repeat this exact same prompt to you for future projects
Also, from now on, nextjs will be the way to go instead of react, so also make sure you take that into account.
